# Introductory Material [Go to File](INSERT URL)
The U.S. Army has a continuing need to understand human and environmental health risks associated with military-relevant compounds (MRCs) and with movement off-site of range munition constituents (MCs). The U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center is now developing a renewed product ⸺ the Fate and Risk Evaluation System for Contaminants (FRESCO™) ⸺ that builds on and updates the Training Range Environmental Evaluation and Characterization System (TREECS™, 2008-present) and the earlier Adaptive Risk Assessment Modeling System (ARAMS™, 2000-2007) to address the Army’s needs and further support the Operational Range Assessment Program.   

## Understanding Risks 
FRESCO™ extends ARAMS™ and TREECS™ capabilities for modeling fate and transport of MRCs and MCs to establish media concentrations for comparison to risk-based screening levels (Level 1 risk assessment). The extended capabilities are being implemented in concert with modernization of the supporting data, the codebase ⸺ including the underlying Framework for Risk Analysis in Multimedia Environmental Systems (FRAMES) modeling framework developed at the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) ⸺ and documentation to deliver a sustainable and reliable platform for MC/MRC risk assessment for the long term.
